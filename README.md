# Does female survival to age 65 coincide with changes in male survival to age 65 in Antigua and Barbuda between 1960 and 2020?

## Abstract

Using World Bank World Development Indicators, this study investigates the relationship between female and male survival to age 65 in Antigua and Barbuda from 1960 to 2020. The descriptive evidence reveals that both female and male survival rates improved dramatically over the six-decade period; however, male survival consistently remained approximately 10 percentage points below female survival. This persistent gap highlights enduring gender differences in longevity despite broad improvements in population health. The findings underscore that even when overall health outcomes improve, gender disparities can remain structurally entrenched, emphasizing the importance of targeted public health policies and interventions that address differences in male and female mortality.

## 1. Question

Does female survival to age 65 coincide with changes in male survival to age 65 in Antigua and Barbuda between 1960 and 2020?

- **Measure of female survival**: Female survival to age 65 (% of cohort)
- **Measure of male survival**: Male survival to age 65 (% of cohort)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Female survival to age 65 (% of cohort)
  - Male survival to age 65 (% of cohort)
- **Coverage**: Antigua and Barbuda, 1960–2020
- **Notes**: National-level data only

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for Antigua and Barbuda.
2. **Selected relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, Value.
3. Pivoted indicators into separate columns and sorted by year.
4. Produced a line graph comparing female and male survival rates over time.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **Female survival to age 65**: Increased steadily and substantially across the 1960–2020 period.
- **Male survival to age 65**: Also increased sharply but remained consistently around 10 percentage points lower than female survival.
- **Comparison**: Both sexes experienced major health gains, yet the persistent survival gap demonstrates enduring gender disparities in longevity.

(Table 1. Pivoted dataset)

## 5. Interpretation

- Antigua and Barbuda achieved large improvements in life expectancy for both sexes over six decades, reflecting better healthcare access, public health interventions, and socioeconomic development.
- The persistent 10-point gap between female and male survival indicates that biological, behavioral, or social determinants continue to produce systematic differences in longevity.
- These trends suggest that broad health improvements alone do not automatically eliminate gender disparities, highlighting the need for policies that address male-specific mortality risks or health behaviors.

## 6. Limitations

- Only two indicators analyzed; multidimensional poverty dynamics not fully captured.
- National-level data may obscure important regional or urban–rural variation.
- No causal relationships tested.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Investigate underlying causes of gender mortality differences (e.g., cardiovascular disease, occupational hazards).
- Incorporate subnational or cohort-level data to examine heterogeneity in survival trends.
- Explore correlations with social, economic, or behavioral variables to understand drivers of male-female survival gaps.
- Compare Antigua and Barbuda’s trends to other Caribbean nations to assess regional patterns of gendered longevity.
